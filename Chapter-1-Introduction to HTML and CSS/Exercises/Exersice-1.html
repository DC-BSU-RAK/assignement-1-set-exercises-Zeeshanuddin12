    <hr>

    <h2>Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of heavy cream (that's about 500 ml)</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean (or just use 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract if that's easier)</li>
        <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of granulated sugar (plus a little extra to sprinkle on top later)</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Procedure </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven</li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 150°C (300°F).Heat gently over heat until warm (not boiling).Cool and leave aside for 10-15 minutes. Remove vanilla pod.</p>

        <li>Prepare Egg Mix</li>
        <p>Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, and pinches of salt in a bowl until pale yellow.</p>

        <li>Temper the Eggs</li>
        <p>Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, and pinches of salt in a bowl until pale yellow.</p>

        <li>Strain and Pour</li>
        <p>Strain into a jug to avoid lumps.Fill equal amounts into the ramekins.</p>

        <li>Bake in a Water Bath</li>
        <p>Half fill the tray with hot water, to the ramekin sides.
Bake for 30–35 minutes until the custard is set (the centre will still jiggle slightly).</p>

        <li>Caramelize the Top</li>
        <p>Dust each chilled custard with 1 teaspoon of sugar.
Caramelize the sugar with a kitchen torch until golden and crunchy.
(If you don't have a torch, you can place the ramekins under a broiler on high for 2–3 minutes, keeping an eye on them.)</p>
    </ol>
